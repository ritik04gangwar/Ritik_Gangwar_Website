      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Ritik gangwarâ€”a passionate software developer with a keen
        interest in building innovative solutions, machine learning and
        full-stack development. My journey in tech began with a curiosity for
        how things work, and over the years, this curiosity has evolved into a
        deep love for creating impactful digital experiences. I specialize in
        JavaScript, React.js, Python, and machine learning algorithms, and I've
        had the privilege of working on diverse projects. My goal is always to
        blend creativity with technical precision to deliver solutions that are
        not only functional but also beautiful and intuitive. Beyond my
        technical work, I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and
        collaboration. I thrive in environments that challenge me to grow, and
        I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities to expand my skill set
        and contribute to exciting projects.
